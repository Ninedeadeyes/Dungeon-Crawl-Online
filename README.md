# Dungeon Crawl Online 

Purpose :  The main aim of the project was to convert my Python 2D ASCII Engine to JavaScript, providing a simple method of creating 2 D games using JavaScript. 
I created a mini dungeon crawler where the main aim is to escape the dungeon with as much loot as possible without falling victim to the inhabitants of the dungeon. 

Include a simplify'core' game engine to create your own 2d Adventures with JavaScript 

Features 

- Implemented an example of Asynchronous programming with the use of async and await fetching a random joke 'API' when you encounter the Mad Jester  
- Original Music
- Multi-level Dungeon
