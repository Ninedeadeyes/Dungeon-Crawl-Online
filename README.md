# Mini-Crawl

Purpose :  The main aim of the project was to convert my Python 2D ASCII Engine to JavaScript, providing a simple method of creating 2 D games using JavaScript. 
I created a mini dungeon crawler where the main aim is to escape the dungeon with as much loot as possible without falling victim to the inhabitants of the dungeon. 

If you would like to download the 'core' game engine to make your own games, you can download it from the game engine folder.
