# Mini-Crawl

Purpose :  The main aim of the project was to convert my Python 2D ASCII Engine to JavaScript,providing a simple method of creating 2 D text games using JavaScript. 
I created a mini dungeon crawler where the main aim is to escape the dungeon with as much loot as possible without falling victims to the inhabitants of the dungeon.
